    <h1>Roles</h1>

    <em>General classifications for extraordinary machines.</em>

    <h3>Artillery</h3>
    <p>Artillery mechs usually stay back
        from the front line, dealing damage or
        providing support. They tend to sport long-range
        weapons and systems.</p>

    <h3>Stiker</h3>
    <p>Strikers are resilient mechs that thrive
        when targets are kept close.</p>

    <h3>Controller</h3>
    <p>Controller mechs are equipped to
        inflict statuses, force or prevent movement, or
        overheat their targets.</p>

    <h3>Support</h3>
    <p>Support mechs specialize in
        increasing the combat capabilities of their allies
        â€“ moving them around, clearing conditions,
        healing, or protecting them from incoming fire.</p>

    <h3>Defender</h3>
    <p>Defenders are exceptionally durable
        and resilient mechs, designed to control space
        or shield allies from harm.</p>
