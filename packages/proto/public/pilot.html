        <h1>Pilot</h1>

        <em>Hero of the story, of at least your own.</em>

        <p>Pilots are the player character. They have Triggers which are used in relavent narrative moments.<br>
        For example, if a player has a +2 Trigger "Fist to Faces", they will gain +2 on rolls related to something like a bar fight.<br>
        Trigger names are intentionally vague, as the player can argue to the GM if it applies to a situation or not.<br>
        They also have Hull, Agility, Systems, and Engineering stats. These can influence the stats of the Mechs they pilot.<br>

        Pilots of course have names and background, which summerize their upbringing. These are made at the discretion of the player.
