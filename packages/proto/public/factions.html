        <h3>General Massive Systems</h3>
        <em>From Cradle to the stars, GMS:<br>
            assured quality, universal licensing, total coverage.</em>
        <p>GMS is one of the oldest fabricators in the galaxy, first
            getting its start in the early days of the colonization rush.
            The manufacturer hails from Cradle, the home of Union –
            and humanity – and thus its designs reflect the sensibilities
            of the first pioneers to seek the stars. Today, GMS
            products are available anywhere there is access to the
            omninet. These products, whether consumer, specialty,
            or military, are widely viewed as the galactic minimum of
            quality: not particularly luxurious, but unsurpassed in nononsense
            design, reliability, and ease of use.<br><br>
            Where GMS
            is available, anything less is unacceptable.</p>

        <h3>IPS-Northstar</h3>
        <em>Your friend in an unfriendly sea.</em>
        <p>IPS-Northstar (IPS-N) was created from the merger of
            two civilian interstellar freight and transportation
            companies, Interplanetary Shipping and Northstar.
            The resulting firm, IPS-N is a titanic entity – one of the
            first corpro-states – with a virtual monopoly over
            interplanetary and interstellar shipping. Other firms
            exist, but their gross fleet strength is but a shadow of
            IPS-N’s fleets of tankers, haulers, freighters, and
            intergate/interstellar liners. Wherever goods and raw
            materials need to be moved, you can bet a crew in
            IPS-N uniforms will be there.</p>

        <h3>Smith-Shimano Corpro</h3>
        <em>You only need one.</em>
        <p>Smith-Shimano Corpro (SSC) is the second-oldest
            corporation in the galaxy, preceded only by GMS.
            Founded by Cartwright Smith and Shimano Hideyoshi,
            SSC’s emphasis on private stellar and
            interstellar travel, the fantastic wealth of its founders,
            and favorable contracts within Union’s First
            Committee, Smith-Shimano quickly became an early
            leader in the race to develop sublight, downwell, and
            EVA vehicles. SSC grew throughout Union’s First
            Expansion Period, managing the majority of all private
            and corporate contracts’ design, outfitting, and
            clinical needs. Over time, the corporation diversified
            to specialize in bio-bespoke, long-range scout suits –
            personalized hard suits, for those with the manna to
            afford them.</p>

        <h3>HORUS</h3>
        <em>Congratualtions Pilot. You have been chosen. Access is yours, so long as you can keep it.</em>
        <p>HORUS is an oddity among the various pan-galactic
            corpro-states, outfitters, and manufacturers. Operating
            in a gray legal state between harmless omninet
            communes, open-source fabrication collaboratives,
            black-market printers, and deeper, more esoteric
            collectives, HORUS is counted among the Big Four
            not due to its influence on galactic politics, but
            because of its ubiquitous coverage: one can be
            certain that wherever there is omninet, HORUS is
            either there or soon to follow. Rumors abound as to
            the manufacturer’s nature – some say it’s the dream
            of an unshackled NHP or a hacker collective dedicated
            to open-source manufacturing (at its most
            mundane levels); others insist that it’s the proving
            ground for one of the corpro-states’ R&D departments,
            or the realspace projection of an alien entity’s
            ongoing wish.</p>

        <h3>Harrison Armory</h3>
        <em>Superior by design.</em>
        <p>Harrison Armory enjoys a galaxy-wide reputation for
            the quality of its weapons and defensive systems. The
            corpro-state previously specialized in ordnance and
            other armaments, making it reliant on competitors’
            frames as mounts for its deluxe equipment; however,
            since the overthrow of Union’s Second Committee,
            Harrison Armory has broadened its product line to
            include an extensive range of peerless frontline
            frames. On the wave of this new success, the Armory
            has transformed into a burgeoning, imperial corprostate,
            a mighty galactic power that directly administers
            a large number of Core worlds, orbitals, and
            colonial prospects – this is the Purview; all lands
            under the Armory’s command.</p>
