    <em>GMS Standard Pattern 1</em>

    <blockquote>Most humans don’t think to ask about the history of the water they drink,
        the earth they walk, or the air they breathe. And yet, without water,
        earth, and air, there would be nowhere for humanity to make a home.<br><br>
        Just the same, the GMS-SP1 “Everest” is often taken for granted, its
        importance dismissed in favor of other, more specialized frames. A plain
        and unpretentious mech, defined by simple lines, functional grace,
        universal compatibility, and sturdy bulk, the Everest is as fundamental to
        the modern mechanized chassis as the natural world is to human life. The
        Everest isn’t the most specialized mech, but it is the backbone of our
        expansion imperative. From its shoulders, humanity steps.<br><br>
        Prior to GMS’s official adoption of the name, “Everest” was a use-name
        given to the frame by its pilots. Mount Everest – or Sagarmatha, or
        Chomolungma, as it has been called in older human tongues – is the tallest
        mountain on Cradle, though not the most prominent peak in known space, nor
        even the greatest in Cradle’s star system, yet pilots across the galaxy
        call their SP1s by that ancient name. Why?<br><br>
        The sentimental answer is that the name is a reminder of what was once the
        limit of human endurance – once the height of human achievement. To reach
        Everest’s summit was to defy death and stand atop the world – the
        culmination of months, even years, of training, investment, and hard work.
        Reaching the peak was also a triumph of the people, systems, and
        institutions behind the individual – a triumph too often left
        unacknowledged, or deliberately erased.<br><br>
        Sagarmatha. Chomolungma.<br><br>
        Even before the Fall, when the Massif vaults were built, some names – some
        stories – were given priority over others.<br><br>
        The real story behind the Everest’s name is likely much less deliberate.
        Somewhere along the line, a newly graduated pilot, frustrated by GMS’s
        plain naming conventions, painted “EVEREST” across the flank of their SP1.
        Maybe it was a callsign, or maybe it represented the pride they felt at
        success. Either way, the name stuck: others adopted the name, and over five
        centuries it grew to become the officially unofficial designation of the SP1
        chassis.<br><br>
        Veteran pilots may never return to the Everest after moving on, but
        they’ll always remember reaching that first summit – the mountaintop where
        they proved they could plant their own flag at the peak of the world.<br><br>

        Everest – you’ll never forget it.</blockquote>
