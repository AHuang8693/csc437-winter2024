    <em>1 SP, Unique</em>
        <main>
            When you take structure damage, roll 1d6. On a 6,
            you return to <strong>1 HP</strong> and ignore the damage – the hit
            simply ‘scratched your paint’.<br><br>
            This system can only be used once before each
            <Strong>Full Repair</Strong>, and is not a valid target for system
            destruction.
