    <h1>Weapons</h1>

    <em>Tools of destruction, oppression, and liberationâ€”all in your hands.</em>

    <p>Each weapon has its own Size/Type, Tags, Range/Threat, and Damage<br><br>
    Size ranges from Auxiliary, Main, Heavy, and Super Heavy, taking the respective Mount slots on a Mech.<br>
    Types include Rifle, Cannon, CQB, Melee, Nexus, and Launcher.<br>
    Tags are numerous and relect properties of the weapon. Some of them are Accurate, Overkill, AP, Reliable, and Ordnance.<br>
    Range represents how many spaces a weapon can reach. They may also have AoE patterns like Cone, Burst, Line, and Blast<br>
    Threat is the range weapons can be used in Overwatch. Default is 1, but can vary between weapons, especially Melee and CQB.<br>
    Damage is represented by dice and flat numbers, categorized into three types: Kinetic, Energy, and Explosive.<br>
